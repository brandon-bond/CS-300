What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem that was being solved for this course was to make a system be able to read a file and update that file. The Problem that was being solved
in the project was creating a system that can read, update, and print information on class requirements for the prerequisites of that course.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In the approach to the problem I always first look at the rubric for the assignments to understand the requirments for that assignment. Next I would
use the knoledge from the previous assignments or what we learned in the weekly zybooks activities to apply them to the assignment. Another resource
that was extremly helpful is youtube or online forums that show how to deal with any problem. It is important to understand data structures for 
algorithms to maintain efficiency, what data structure is good for certain situations and what is most efficient or optimized for the information
that is being processed. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I ran into a few roadblocks and the best way I delt with my issues was youtube videos, the problems I was having was having this as my first c++ course. 
previously I did some work in c++, but this was for a intro to game development class that had the programming bundled in with the bluprint system of 
unreal engine. I would watch youtube videos on my break from work and learn about c++ and how the language was supposed to be written.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The work on this project helped me understand more about algorithms and mainly how to create code to read and update a file. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

One of the best things that I have learned in this course was the ability to comment in the code properly. This would help to understand what is going on
in the code to people that have not seen the code yet and yourself if you need to come back to the code. Another thing that helped me with this final project
was reading the other assignments and learning how the prewritten code was made. This would help me be able to make my code more readable and maintainable too.
